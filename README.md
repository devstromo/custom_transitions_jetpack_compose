# Custom Transitions Jetpack Compose

Welcome to the Custom Transitions Jetpack Compose repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating how to create custom animations and transitions in Android apps using Jetpack Compose. Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. This repository serves as a practical reference for developers interested in adding smooth and responsive animations to their Compose applications.
